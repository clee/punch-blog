title: mmm. kerberos.
published: true

so I finished setting up a working LDAP server here at home. with
Kerberos, for that single-sign-on goodness. I can see why people dig
this. I can also see why people fucking hate it. awesome features,
complete and total pain in the ass to set up. honestly, I think I
probably would rather have installed openBSD, and that's saying a lot.

but now that it's working, and I have it set up, I am a golden god.
