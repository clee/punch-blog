I hate Internet Explorer. If you happen to be unfortunate enough to be
using it, please, consider either upgrading to [Firefox][] or convincing
the people in charge over in IT to give it a shot. Firefox actually
supports web standards - those neat things that make it possible for
people to write all sorts of really neat web pages, without having to
resort to evil nasty hacks.

I have no idea what this page looks like under IE5. My closest guess
would be that it looks like a plate full of ass, and if it does, then
too bad. There are at least a half dozen other web browsers you can use
that will render this site properly, and if all else fails you could
always upgrade to IE6 since that works for now.

In the future, my "compatibility" with IE is going to consist of hiding
things that the browser doesn't understand, instead of trying to get it
to work.
