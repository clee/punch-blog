Finally feels like things are going places. I just got back from a great
week and a half in Arizona on Wednesday night; for whatever reason, I
came down with a fever almost immediately after I got back, which
included a really nasty throat condition where it hurt to swallow. Fever
broke a day or two ago, but the throat still hurts. Nasty.

For the first time since I can remember, Arizona was actually <u>fun</u>
to be in. I had a BLAST. Kyle came down from Colorado; I got to see
pretty much every single one of my friends; I got [a tattoo][]; and I
did some other things which I'm quite proud of, but which aren't fit to
print, especially not on a public blog like this. I even got to say
"goodbye" to a few of my old teachers from high school, which was
awesome.

And, to top it all off, I move into my new apartment on Tuesday (yeah, I
got approved!) and two weeks from that, I start at redhat. Even cooler
is that [daniels][] is coming up on July 11th, and we're gonna go crash
OLS and kick some ass in Canada.

Oh, and apparently (according to Steph) I've become some sort of a pimp.
Can't argue with that. :)
