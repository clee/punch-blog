title: oil change

Changed the oil on my car this morning. Heading up to Boston today to go
look for an apartment/housing, as well as to go to the X Developers
Conference - hooray!

Something about doing an oil change is satisfying. I don't know exactly
what it is, though. Just feels good. I'm also glad to note that my car
appears to not be burning oil, which may have something to do with my
satisfaction.

Oh, and I got hired by Red Hat.
