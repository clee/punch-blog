So, I have had a lot of respect for the GNOME hackers for a long time. I
have been incredibly happy that the core hackers in each camp have got
along with cheerfulness, decorum and mutual respect - even while some
overzealous members of our user communities have flamed and bickered,
generating this idea of "The Desktop War".

But this week, a bunch of actual GNOME developers - not random gimps
being idiots - have acted like children and made everyone working on the
Linux desktop look like a bunch of juveniles. I'm very disappointed.

How do they expect corporations to take Linux desktop efforts seriously
with a release name like ["That and a pair of testicles"][]? Some people
have mentioned that this won't reflect badly on KDE since GNOME and KDE
are only related by virtue of being alternatives to eachother; they
might have a point, but in reality, nobody in the Windows world knows
the difference between KDE and GNOME and this sort of crap makes Linux
desktop acceptance that much more difficult for everyone involved.

Very disappointed.
