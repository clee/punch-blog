Stroking is hard. So hard.

Every time I hear the word 'stroke' from now on, I'm going to hear
keithp purr. That disturbs me to no end.

In other news, the DDC at OLS has been a lot of fun. I'm going to have
to disagree with chouimat about a few things - namely, I think that Xgl
is extremely sexy, and has a hell of a future, and while it's true that
the vast majority of the talks here are GNOME-related or have a GNOME
bias... it's because we are vastly outnumbered on this side of the pond,
and you can count the number of KDE developers at this conference on one
hand.

George Staikos was here for a couple of hours, I've been here for the
DDC but not OLS, chouimat was here (but let's face it, you haven't been
active in KDE lately, chouimat, and neither have I), and Alexander Dymo
is here and gave a talk about KDevelop. We're not exactly taking over
here. We need more of a presence at these shows, people. It's important.
