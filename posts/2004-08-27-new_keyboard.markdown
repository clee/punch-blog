[caillon][] is buying me a new keyboard soon.

Poor bastard. :)

In related news, Steph is back in town for the weekend. It really sucks
that I miss her so much when she's gone. Son of a bitch, I really wasn't
expecting that. Gah.

Watched <u>Requiem for a Dream</u> and <u>Frailty</u> tonight. Both of
those movies rock. Steph had never seen either one of them; she ended up
liking <u>Frailty</u> more, which is interesting. <u>Requiem</u> still
fucks with me. The music in that movie is excellent, as is the
cinematography.

I definitely feel bad for caillon though. The forty-five minute drive
home has got to be killing him.
