So Maksim (aka SadEagle) did some awesome hacking on my crazy widget
style and fixed a few of the bugs that I've been too lazy (or too
stupid) to fix myself lately. This has kickstarted me into looking at
some more of my code, and I've actually been hacking on things lately.

I also have an evil plan regarding kdelibs... How much would everyone
hate me if I split out the sub-libraries within the kdelibs package into
smaller individual packages and ported them to use pkg-config instead of
the voodoo that is our admin/ build system?
