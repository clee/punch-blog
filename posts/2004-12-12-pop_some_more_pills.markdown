My addiction to caffeine may actually be completely over.

I succumbed to the desire to have a can of Coke on Friday night but the
really strange thing is that it didn't even really taste good. And I
haven't had any headaches all day so I don't think that I'm actually
caffeine-dependent anymore.

I'm still not sure whether or not I should count this against my
Operation Zero Caffeine initiative. I didn't even finish the whole can,
sadly. (And I think we all know how much I hate wasting things.)

But I did crumble, and then found the soda to be less than I had
remembered it. Somehow, it just wasn't the same. I feel...
disenfranchised, I think. Maybe a little disappointed.

Oh well. At least the headaches are still gone.
