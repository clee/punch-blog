Heh. I almost forgot that we went to go meet with a couple of Ximian
guys in Cambridge last night. Ray, John Palmieri, Dan Reed and myself
all met up right outside the T and we were completely pimped out in our
stylish red fedoras (those hats rock). We had dinner at this cool place
called CBC - can't remember what it stood for - and then we met the
monkeys over at a pool hall.

Dave Camp is a funny motherfucker.

And Luis Villa is also pretty funny, but in a more quiet sort of way.
Dave is funny in an "I'm the asshole that everyone loves to hate" way,
which is fine with me. Upon seeing us in our (ridiculously sexy) red
hats, he told us to get the hell out of his bar. We laughed, and then
someone mentioned that I'm the guy he should kick out since I work on
KDE. (I think that it might've been me who mentioned it, but anyway.) So
then he looks at me and proceeds to tell me "Ok, they're cool, but YOU
definitely need to leave." And then we had a fun time bullshitting about
various things, including the whole Novell/Ximian/SUSE craziness.

Dave's version of a meeting with one of our KDE guys over at SUSE in
Germany:

"So, what're you gonna do if they pick GNOME?"  
"I'm going to quit." ::pause:: "What're you going to do if they pick
KDE?"  
"I'm gonna quit."  
::silence::  
"Well, cheers!" ::drinking::

Heh.
