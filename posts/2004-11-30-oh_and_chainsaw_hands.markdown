title: oh! and chainsaw hands!

Well, ok, no chainsaw hands, but I got my replacement laptop from work
today. It's an X31 - smaller and sexier than my old T41, which was
stolen from my car while I slept.

Don't think I'll be leaving this one in the car. Ever.

But yeah, I'm excited. FC3 actually isn't as bad as previous releases,
so I'm keeping it on there... I'm probably going to see about taking
over those KDE specfiles so I can have less-shitty KDE packages on
Fedora, but we'll see. Don't want to go around making promises and
disappointing people.

I should really do a TODO one of these days and list out the stuff I
need to take care of. Like that pyblosxom plugin. Damn.
