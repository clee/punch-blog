title: implementing ideas

I like getting around to implementing the various ideas that I bounce
back and forth inside my skull.

One of those ideas that I had for a long time was to solder a PS/2-\>USB
converter directly into an IBM Model M keyboard, along with a USB plug
so that I could just swap out USB cables to plug the keyboard into the
computer.

[I have finally done that][], after some [inspiration from zevv][], a
few choice purchases at Fry's Electronics, and a few borrowed parts from
my friend Cliff.

I have to say, this kicks way more ass than even I had hoped. (ajax, eat
your heart out.)

Still on the list:  

-   finish the Qt4 frontend for HandBrake
-   write my own email client that doesn't suck balls
-   write my own AIM client that doesn't suck balls
-   hack up some apps for Qtopia/Opie/whatever for my shiny new iPaq
    3670

I know there's more than that, but those are the ones that are currently
taking up the most brainspace, so I'm going to have to get to them
sometime.

Due to United Airlines sucking balls, [Dave Airlie][] crashed at my
place last night after they called back and cancelled his flight from
SFO to Sydney. I've said this before, although maybe not on this blog,
but United are a bunch of cockbags. They have fucked up at least one leg
of every single trip of mine that they've ever been involved in. In any
case, I know far too many foreigners named Dave.

Also, I've been growing [this][] out for the first time ever. Looks like
I'm going to have to update my various avatars...
