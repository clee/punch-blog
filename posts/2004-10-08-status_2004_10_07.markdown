Damn. The past week has been awesome.  

-   Did the functional testing and RHNQA on a KDE errata here.
-   Filed bugs against gnome-panel, evolution-data-server,
    bonobo-activation-server, and ran into a terribly amusing metacity
    crasher.
-   Did the functional testing on an ugly cyrus-sasl vulnerability.
-   Did a \*new\* round of functional testing on a bug caused by the fix
    to the ugly cyrus-sasl vulnerability.
-   Pushed a release of redhat-artwork sometime last week anyway.
-   Continued hacking on the Qt port of BlueCurve.

All in all, dangerously productive. Not to mention keeping track of
email and IRC.
