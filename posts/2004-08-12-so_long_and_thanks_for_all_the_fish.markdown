Wow, lots of news since last time I blogged. First off, sorry about the
server being down; apparently we had a hardware failure on the machine
that my blog and planet KDE are both hosted on, and I was ill-prepared
for it; my mail was down for a few hours, as well, which was no good.

Steph got hired as a nanny in New York. She's moving her stuff out this
weekend. I'm excited for her - I think she's going to do an awesome job
as a nanny, and she's great with kids; but I'm also really going to miss
her. Steph is awesome, and the apartment isn't going to be the same
without her.

In other news, we went down to Long Island last weekend. I had a blast;
it felt so great to be home again, and I got to see a couple of my
friends. We went to the beach at Smith Point and I got my ass kicked by
the waves. I still have a couple of sand burns on my back to prove it.

caillon, J5, maureen, and halfline came over last night. There was
hookah and Gamecube, and much rejoicing. Found a smoke shop in Salem, NH
that sells shisha, and I picked up two packs of grape. If it's good,
I'll be going back frequently; if it's not, I guess it's back to
ordering from the internet. I don't know why, but there's just something
satisfying about the whole instant gratification thing.
