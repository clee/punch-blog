Tomorrow is going to be **interesting**, I think.

I'm landing in an airport I've never been to, in a country where I don't
speak the native language, and I have to make it from the airport to the
train station (which is not attached to the airport, but is at least two
subway stops away). Once the train arrives at the destination, I still
have to make it from the train station to the place I'm actually
staying, which is of course not exactly close by.

Since I'll be in Spain and my phone won't work there, the best way to
contact me is either IM or email; I won't be getting any voicemails
until September 3 at the earliest.
