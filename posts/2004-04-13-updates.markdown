so, where to begin - it's been way too long since I wrote anything down;
my apologies to anyone out there reading but I haven't had nearly as
much internet access as usual lately, and I can't seem to find any
decent blogging software for OS X so I may end up having to write my
own.

in other news.... Steph has decided not to move out here. shocking, I
know. it's actually kind of sad, because she's really cool, and I was
kinda looking forward to her moving out here. on the other hand, it's
rather freeing, and I realized the other day that I'm officially more
free right now, at this very moment, than I've ever been before in my
life. I have no responsibilities to anyone, really - I have no
obligations to maintain, no relationships holding me down or keeping me
from doing what I want, and it's sort of a scary place to be. hopefully
things will firm up a bit soon; it's an interesting place to be at,
though.

have been going to interviews and submitting the resume at tons of
places up here. no solid results yet, unfortunately.
