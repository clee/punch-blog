title: sync script

I'm on IRC the other day and my pal Daniel asks me if I'd be interested
in taking care of a sysadmin task for him on the freedesktop.org box
(pdx). I wasn't doing anything so I said "Sure, what is it?" and he
tells me he needs a script to:

-   Copy over the entire CVS tree from the CVSROOT
-   Check out the latest code from each module in each CVS tree, and
    package it up
-   Also, pants

</p>
I wrote it. It's neat. Hadn't done any shell scripting in a while, but
this was relaxing and it gave me a chance to exercise some of my skills,
which is always good.
