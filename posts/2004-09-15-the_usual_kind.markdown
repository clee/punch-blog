The ride back from Long Island last night was unbelievable. The fog was
incredible - I literally could not see three cars ahead of me at times.
Not that there were any cars on the road anyway, but still - the
visibility levels hit some pretty scary depths on the 495. And the
temperature dropped pretty low as well; not sure if that was a side
effect of the speed I was driving at, or both windows being down, or
what, but it was pretty crazy.

The weekend in general was just a crazy wild ride. Got to see Kyle
again, which is always a good time. I'm proud that he's my friend. His
pimposity has reached awesome new highs, and I have to salute him; we
had a blast. Watched the Punisher on DVD as well, which was awesome.

Not everything went perfectly, of course, but hey. Life goes on.
