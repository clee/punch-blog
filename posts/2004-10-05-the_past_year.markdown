I was reading [Cliff's LiveJournal][] and I started thinking about my
own life, especially the past year.

Overall, I have to admit that I'm surprised at where I am today.

I mean, a year ago... well, without going into **too** many details, I
don't think it's really an overstatement to say that October 2003 was by
far the worst month of my life. (So far, anyway.)

In short - I got laid off from my previous job; Mickey had sex with
another guy while we were "on a break;" and I got into a car accident.

All in the space of about three weeks.

This October is looking to be a lot better; I'm working at Red Hat, and
they absolutely kick ass. I've still got the Tercel, and that car is
awesome to drive. (The manual transmission continues to make me
surprisingly giddy.) I'm living in my own apartment, and the weather is
getting cold enough that I can see my own breath. I finally managed to
get the fuck out of Arizona, where it hit a hundred degrees last week.
I'm still single, and I continue to have the amazing luck of The Nice
Guy, but I'm used to that, so it's not really surprising. Being single
is both better and worse; my relationship with Mickey was so fucked up
that it was worse than being alone, overall, but I hate being alone.

Still, taking everything into consideration... I think I'm doing a hell
of a lot better where I am now. And it's good to know that - no matter
how bad this month might be - it's going to be awfully hard for it to be
worse than the same time last year.
