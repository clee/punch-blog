**\* clee** kicks ajax  
[clee] dammit, man. I really want a usable Expose feature. Like,
yesterday would have been good.  
[ajax] oh yeah, totally my fault  
**\* clee** blames you.  
[ajax] why yesterday?  
[clee] ajax: well, yesterday would have been good. today would have been
acceptable. but if it gets here tomorrow, that's not soon enough.  
**\* clee** sighs  
[ajax] i was thinking maybe there was some event yesterday  
[clee] hahaha  
[clee] no.  
[ajax] like you were trying to show off X to some hottie in the coffee
shop or something  
[clee] hahahaha  
[daniels] haha  
[clee] and she whips out a Mac and she's like "Let's see your
network-transparent windowing system do THIS!" and hits F9?  
[ajax] but then she's all "shit boy, five year old acceleration
architectures ain't gonna get you any poon"  
[clee] yeah, happens to me all the time  
[ajax] \*smack\*
