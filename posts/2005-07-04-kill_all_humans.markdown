Some asshole thought it would be a good idea to string up yellow
"CAUTION" tape and block one of the one-way roads leading to my
apartment building inside of the complex.

I was not amused.

I stopped my car, pulled up the handbrake, flipped on the emergency
lights, got out, and walked to one side of the tape. I ripped it off,
and some guy screamed out "HEY!!!" I turned to his general direction and
flipped him off, and walked across the street to the other side, where I
pulled down the rest of the tape and tossed it into my car.

Got back into my car and parked in my parking lot without incident,
throwing out the tape on my way in to my apartment.

God dammit, I hate people sometimes.
