title: planet KDE

I was discussing how addictive [Planet GNOME][] and [Planet Debian][]
are on \#kde-devel with a few KDE developers and we lamented the lack of
a Planet KDE. However, unlike them, I actually decided to get up and do
something about it.

Behold! [Planet KDE][]!

Yes. It's ugly. It's also fairly empty. Until [Ian][] fixes up
kdedevelopers.org (see how [messed up][] the feeds are?) so that it
includes \<pubDate\> tags so that the blog entries get sorted correctly,
we're pretty lonely over here.

The good news is, if you're a KDE developer with a blog on your own
site, [mail me][] the URL of your properly-formed RSS feed, tell me what
you do in KDE, and I'll add you to the blogroll as soon as possible.

  [Planet Debian]: http://planet.debian.net/
