How's this for a reason?

I called up HP/Compaq, Dell, and IBM today. I can't get a
notebook/laptop computer from any one of these manufacturers without
paying for a Windows license.

That's right. I can't even get any of these systems blank, sans
operating system. I explained to the guys over the phone - and
especially the HP rep seemed sympathetic - but the problem is that
Microsoft has strongarmed these manufacturers such that they can't ship
any laptops without a Microsoft OS.

This is complete and utter bullshit. I'm just going to wipe the hard
drive and put Linux on it anyway; I'd rather that the hard drive just
came blank, as I don't expect any of the hardware guys to install Linux
on it for me.

Ugh. I was hoping that one of these guys might be able to set themselves
apart from the rest by satisfying this one wish. Looks like I was wrong.
