WARNING: Story involving earwax follows.

About a week and a half ago, I took a shower and got some water stuck in
my ear. This has happened many times before, but I was impatient this
particular time and instead of waiting for it to drain I decided to take
matters into my own hands. I grabbed a Q-tip and plunged it deep into my
ear, and instead of freeing the water and making everything better I
apparently pressed something shut and turned off my hearing in my left
ear.

This condition of half-deafness lasted for over a week.

Just yesterday (well, the night before last night, anyway, but at like
3AM) I got so pissed off that I started digging at the inner canal of my
left ear trying desperately to shake out or loosen up whatever it was
that had gotten caught. Amazingly enough, I succeeded, without causing
any damage. And now I can hear again.

It's amazing how much I took the whole being-able-to-hear-from-both-ears
thing for granted. I shall never do so again.
