Can't figure out why I can't sleep. Normally I have no problems falling
asleep, but the past few days have sucked pretty badly. No idea what the
fuck is going on but I'm not digging it.

The other thing that's really screwing with me is that even though it's
taking me forever to get to sleep, my body seems to think that waking up
at about 7AM is perfect. My brain disagrees pretty violently. It goes
something like this:

06:59 [body] HEY IT IS TIME TO WAKE UP WAHOO MOVING NOW  
06:59 [brain] what the... son of a bitch, CUT THAT SHIT OUT  
07:00 [body] hmmm.  
07:02 [body] NOPE! MOVING AROUND AND GETTING UP NOW  
07:02 [brain] I swear... you will pay for this.  
07:28 [brain] holy shit, why am I awake?

Ugh.

Steph came back up today. Kinda caught me by surprise since I wasn't
even sure if she was going to come up at all. She picked up **Super
Troopers** which is absolutely hysterical. I got the new Bowling for
Soup album, with the song 1985 on it for her at Barnes & Noble. (She
loves that song.) Typical whiny punk stuff, but the song is definitely
catchy.
