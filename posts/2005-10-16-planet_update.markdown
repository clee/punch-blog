For those of you who are syndicated on Planet KDE and also care about
your bandwidth: Please pay attention to this message.

<p>
By default, Planet KDE will now show any images that you include in your
blog. If you do not wish for images from your blog to show up on the
Planet (which I can understand, since we do use up quite a bit of
bandwidth), now you just have to do:  

    <img class="hidefromplanet" src="foo.png" />

</p>
The old class="showonplanet" is still around, but it's irrelevant now
and may be removed in the future.
