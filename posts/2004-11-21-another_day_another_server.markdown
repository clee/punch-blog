The machine which was previously hosting c133.org (my domain) was
compromised recently. So I set about finding new hosting, and I did
thanks to Warren Togami (a coworker of mine at Red Hat) so you are now
seeing c133.org on a brand-new box.

One interesting side effect of this is that my weblog is now statically
generated instead of dynamically so. I haven't really changed the layout
or anything, or even the design, but the filesystem paths have been
played with a bit and the configuration has been gently tweaked. So now
my blog should be even faster.

Oh, and [planet KDE][] has a new home as well. Thanks to Stephen
Depooter, it's now on a separate machine from c133.org and very
unscientific cursory testing shows to me that it's even more
well-connected than it was before. So, despite the fact that the breakin
shut down the sites, I think that they're both better off now. And my
mail seems to have mostly caught up with itself. Which is good.

now that I've been forced to get off my ass and actually look over the
files on the site, I've done a little tiny bit of maintenance and
cleaned up a few things that were previously still around. I may even
get around to doing the aforementioned redesign at some point! But I
don't want to make any promises, so I won't.
