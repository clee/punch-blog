title: corner widgets 2

so I was doing it wrong. ceebx's code works great. (I was checking for
currentTab == 0 && cornerWidget, but I needed to be checking for
currentTab == 0 && !cornerWidget. one simple little bug...)

of course, I said I'd probably commit this stuff last night. now I want
to integrate a ConfigPage in with my commit so I can have a huge commit
with new fun stuff in it... :)

â€‹mmm. well, it's nice to have Konqueror drawing the tabwidget correctly
now. it doesn't look so silly anymore.
