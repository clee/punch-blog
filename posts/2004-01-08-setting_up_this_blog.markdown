so pyblosxom is neat software. I like the whole filesystem-to-blog
mapping.

I really should have gone to sleep a long time ago. I'll need to talk to
DanielS about nifty things like blogging via email (which it sounds like
he has working with his, and that's just neat) and I'll probably get
working on a KDE blogging client too.

anyway. I'm out for now. peace, everyone.
