Well, it looks like [KDE.org][] and even [Planet Debian][] have picked
up on the existence of my little project, so I guess it's time to
officially say "Yes, we're live!"

Disclaimers are up, layout is (mostly) finished, other planets have been
linked, seats are in their upright positions... And we are live, ladies
and gents!

Now if only someone would fix up KBlog (or Tack! Tack needs love too!)
Oh, and we need hackergotchi icons. Any artists want to volunteer?
