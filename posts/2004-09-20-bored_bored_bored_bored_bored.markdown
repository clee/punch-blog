Nothing's going on. Everything is just kind of laid-back and I'm cool
with that, except that I have nobody to hang around and do nothing with.

Doing nothing alone is weak. Doing nothing with other people around is
fun. At least then you can have conversations and good times.

I just don't feel like getting up though. I mean, I'm typing this laying
down on my sofa, in my living room... the keyboard is resting with one
end on the sofa and the other propped up against my leg, the mouse is on
the armrest, and I'm laying down with my head facing out, tilted
slightly up so I can see th emonitor. I don't know if I can get much
lazier than this.

Life is good.
