Renewed my lease at my apartment for another year.

I guess I'm happy enough with Royal Crest. It's just that Cambridge is a
lot cooler. If caillon and I had been able to get our act together
earlier, things might have been different, but oh well.

In any case, living at the same address for more than twelve months
feels like some sort of a victory. Therefore, I win.
