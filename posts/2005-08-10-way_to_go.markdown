Lots of things going on lately.

First off, most recently, I started hacking on [EXA support for the tdfx
driver][] - it doesn't do much yet, except for display things wrong and
crash, but hopefully I'm not too far from it working properly.

Second, I finally coerced a graphic designer friend of mine into coming
up with a new layout for my site. It's not live yet, because I'm not
quite happy with it, but it's pretty close to ready (I think) - [take a
look][] and [let me know][] what you think. (Yeah, I know, it's slow.
It's using multiple layers of translucent PNGs, some of which are
position: fixed. I prefer to think of it as "an opportunity for KHTML
optimization.")

Third, I have been hacking on the [Qt4 BitTorrent client from
Andreas][], and it's really cool. There's a very small, slow memory leak
in it, though, which I have to find and destroy.

Other than that, not too much going on. I'm excited about aKademy - only
a couple of weeks away!
