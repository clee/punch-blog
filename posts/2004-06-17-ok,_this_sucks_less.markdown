Ah... I love it when things work out.

So, mere minutes after my last post, lyp pinged me on IRC and we sorted
things out. He's uncomfortable with his personal posts being on Planet
KDE anyway, which I totally understand, so he's set up a new RSS feed
for KDE-related posts. And has thus been re-added to the blogroll, as
has mornfall.

Good times.
