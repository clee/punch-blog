I went to Boston on Wednesday last week for an interview that I had at a
community health center in the city. I got a call the same day from Red
Hat asking if I wanted to come in for an interview the next day, so I
told them "Of course!"

the interview went great! I had the most fun I've ever had interviewing.
I got to meet a bunch of cool guys and I had a blast chatting with them,
about all sorts of stuff. they had me show up at 10AM and I was supposed
to be done by 3, but they kept me until a little after 4. which
hopefully is a good sign, but I don't want to get my hopes \_too\_ far
up.

the hospital was basically a dead end, though. they don't have any
positions for the IS department, but they swore that they would call me
as soon as they do. they did seem to be pretty impressed though, so I
think it went well even if nothing comes of it. it's experience, anyway.
which is always good.
