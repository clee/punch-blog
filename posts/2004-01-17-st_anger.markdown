I've been really getting into Metallica's St. Anger lately. I don't know
why. You can hate me now, I guess - I know that all of the TRUE
METALLICA FANS hate anything more recent than the Black album (which was
good, of course). I guess I'm not a TRUE METALLICA FAN then. that, and
of course anybody who likes Metallica must have hated Napster. I have
some news for you people - Napster was cool, but most of the stuff that
people had on there was shitty. Too many idiots with broken CD rippers
made too many shitty single MP3 copies. The real draw for me with
Napster was the fact that I could find people with similar music
interests, not the quality of the songs. besides, Ogg Vorbis kicks MP3
ass.

in other news, not much is going on. watched some old home videos with
Steph tonight - vintage stuff from the summer before last. good times.
we had dinner at NYPD. reminds me of how much I miss playing hockey.
(Danny Schowe used to work there. I don't think he does anymore, sadly.
He was on my hockey team back in high school though.)

also good: Radiohead's Hail it to the Thief. I don't know why but it
feels like the whole album is different interpretations of the same
emotion. I like it though. need to get my hands on some more of their
stuff. I hear Kid A was pretty good.
