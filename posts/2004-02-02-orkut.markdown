everybody else is blogging about it, so I guess I'll join in too. orkut
is nifty. I don't have five thousand friends, but I think that maybe
instead of being obsessed with collecting as many as possible I'm going
to just use it to keep in touch with the ones that I do have. well, the
ones that are on the service anyway.

other than that, not much news. been listening to Massive Attack's 100th
Window lately. good stuff. really starting to dig Thirteenth Step, as
well, for some reason. I didn't like it that much when I first heard it,
but it's grown on me quite a bit.
