I was lucky enough to get a ticket to attend WWDC this year, and I've
been looking over the session schedule to see what the sessions are,
when I ran across this interesting little blurb:  

> DTrace, an open source project which provides insight into the
> interaction between your code and the OS kernel, is now available as
> part of Leopard. This session will explain how kernel developers can
> both take advantage of, and extend, DTrace's functionality to help
> debug and optimize low-level code.

DTrace in MacOS X? Hell yes!
