Talked to Scott James Remnant today, and asked him about the bug with
atom.xml parsing and \<br/\> elements; he pointed me at his arch tree
and told me to update from there, which I've done.

Net effect, a tiny bump and all of a sudden atom.xml feeds are looking
dead sexy. Anybody who's currently blogging on blogspot - your feeds
should no longer look like crap! There was a small bug for a minute with
the old template, where the (feed) links in the sidebar on the right
were all pointing back to planetKDE.org instead of pointing to the
actual RSS feed from the developer. That's been fixed.

If you notice any other issues, please [let me know][]!
