Sat down with Ed and Zack yesterday and basically did a mind-meld; we
had an hour-plus-long braindump session where I let loose all of the
ideas, concerns, and issues that I've been thinking about as far as
desktop QA goes here at Red Hat.

John Flanagan dropped in towards the end of it, and he seems to be quite
open to a lot of our ideas, which is awesome. Hopefully we can get the
budget/machines allocated to implement the desktop testing lab that we
want to set up; that would be perfect.
