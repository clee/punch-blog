title: 200 gig hard drive

So I got a 200G hard drive today. My dad decided to buy it for me as
payment for all of the work I've been doing trying to get his printer
working exactly the way he wants it.

Mmmmm. New hardware. I've completed the move of my /home over to the new
drive, and now it's just a matter of wiping the 20G drive with my
operating systems on it and using the 40G drive that previously held
/home as my new OS drive. (I can fit more operating systems in 40G than
I can in 20G! WOOOHOOO!)

Also, having the laser printer connected to the Mac works seamlessly
with KDE over the network. I just pointed a KDE app at the Mac's IP, and
it automatically grokked the print queue and even showed me both
printers that have been connected to the Mac - nifty stuff. I love open
source software.

(still have to make progress on some sort of a KDE-pyblosxom client.
moving that to the top of the TODO, once I'm done screwing with the hard
drives.)
