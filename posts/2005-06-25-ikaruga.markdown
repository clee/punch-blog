Somehow, I just spent four hours playing Ikaruga.

[They][] [weren't][] [kidding][]. This game is hard. Holy shit, this
game is hard. I don't think I've ever played a game where it took me
four hours to get to the THIRD STAGE before. This game rules.

I don't think I'll be sleeping this weekend.

(oh, and props to mpyne, who kicks \*major\* ass for dropping Ikaruga to
me in the mail. The note he placed in the case reads "Let me know how
Level 3 is. I only ever made it to the boss of Level 2." Holy shit this
game is hard.)
