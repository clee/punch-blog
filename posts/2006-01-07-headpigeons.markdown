Today is the dawn of a new era!

Today is the first day that I no longer work for Red Hat.

In just a couple of short weeks, I should be in Norway working for my
new employer, Trolltech.

Also, tonight, the second half of Battlestar Galactica season 2 starts!
This new chapter of my life is off to a hella sweet start.
