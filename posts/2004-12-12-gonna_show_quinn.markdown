So I've got a new revision of the Super Nintendo sound chip emulation
code from antires, and after modifying a few parts of my own code the
GStreamer plugin is now working.

Reliably. No more magic, no more crazy kludges. Feels good.

I think that the filter development branch is ready to be merged into
the mainline, which means that the typefind code is next to be written.
Being in deep hack mode is damned refreshing.
