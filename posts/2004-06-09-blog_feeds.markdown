In response to [Roberto's][] query: If you have a blog with a working
RSS feed (e.g., one that includes the \<pubDate\> tags) send an email to
clee@kde.org with your name, what you hack on, and the URL of your RSS
feed, and I'll add you to the blogroll here.

Hopefully Ian will fix up kdedevelopers.org soon so that I can start
pulling those blog entries too.
