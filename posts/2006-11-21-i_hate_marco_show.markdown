title: it's time for the "I Hate Marco Show!"

So it's been playing for a few weeks now, and I just felt that it needed
to be shared with everyone who reads this blog:

[Dexter][].

I don't really know exactly how to put it into words, but there is
something that is sick, and twisted, and oh-so-right about this show
that makes me laugh. The writing, as [aseigo noted][] is amazing, and
the plot throughout Season One so far has been gripping.

If you have a weak stomach, you might not like it. It's definitely not a
show for the young ones, either - strong language, some nudity, lots of
very graphic scenes. The really amusing thing to me, at least, is that
the **really** graphic scenes are not even of violent acts; whoever is
handling the visuals for the show is an absolute genius. Simple acts
like tying shoes and pulling on a T-shirt somehow take on a much more
sinister undertone.

I **highly** recommend checking this show out. It is, by far, my
favorite new show this season, so far even moreso than Heroes. Heroes
keeps leading me along and throwing me a bone every now and then, but
Dexter has been delivering since Episode One and I haven't been
disappointed yet.
