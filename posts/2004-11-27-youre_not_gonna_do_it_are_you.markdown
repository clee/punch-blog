I finally relented. People have been asking me for weeks to add/change
the current class name for images which will show up in blog entries on
Planet KDE, and I've finally made it possible for those of you who do
want to have images show here without using the word "rape" in your
image classes.

(Man, people get upset over the strangest things.)

So, if you want to embed an image and have it also show on the Planet
you can still add 'class="rapemewithachainsawthanks"' but you can also
add the less-risque and more boring 'class="showonplanet"' tag as well.
Your choice.

For the general readership out there, this makes absolutely no
difference whatsoever, incidentally. Images will continue to show or not
show depending on whether or not the blog authors decide to put the
images here.
