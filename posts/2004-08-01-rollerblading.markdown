Went rollerblading for the first time in a couple of years yesterday,
and found out a few interesting things.

-   One of the axles in my left boot has cracked.
-   My bearings are all rusted.
-   I need new laces for my boots.
-   I'm woefully out of shape.
-   No, really. I hurt.

Also did some pushups. That was interesting. Made it to 73 without
stopping, but my back is punishing me for it today. And my chest, and my
arms. Ah, what an awesome feeling... The burn from physical exhaustion
is actually a welcome pain.
