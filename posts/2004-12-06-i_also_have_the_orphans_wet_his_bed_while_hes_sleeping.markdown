It strikes me that I should note that I'm now caffeine-free, and have
been since the day after Thanksgiving. Which, by my reckoning, puts me
on Day 11 of Operation Cold Turkey.

The funny thing is, I sort of quit by accident. I didn't really mean to
stop drinking soda; I just sort of ran out, and then after I'd had some
pretty nasty headaches for a few days I realized that I had been going
without soda for a few days. By the sixth day, the headaches were pretty
much gone, and I'm feeling pretty good about not drinking that stuff at
the moment.

Others have mentioned that they have lost surprising amounts of weight
simply by not drinking soda anymore. I'm interested to see if this
proves true for me as well.
