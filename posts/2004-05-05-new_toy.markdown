Picked up a new toy yesterday, a Logitech USB 200 headset. Hooray for
USB audio! I'm amazed at how nice it is. I'm not an audiophile by any
means, but this headset is a lot better than I was expecting. And it
works great under Linux, as well as OS X. I hear it even works nicely
under Windows...

I love this stuff. Had fun trying to get everything to play to the
headphones, but it wasn't too difficult. Highly recommended.
