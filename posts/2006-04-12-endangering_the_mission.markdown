Took a road trip to Arizona this past weekend. It's a pretty hefty drive
from Palo Alto to Phoenix and back; roughly ten or eleven hours each
way. I got to spend time with Savanah, though, so as far as I'm
concerned it was worth it. Her brother kicked my ass at Halo 2, but that
isn't very surprising since I suck at Halo and its ilk.

I decided that I'm not going to Norway. As much as I would have loved to
go, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't really work out at this point.

I informed Trolltech of my decision last week and when I showed up at
work on Monday, I was in turn informed that since I'm not going to
Norway, there's not really any reason for me to stick around in the Palo
Alto office; end result, I no longer work for Trolltech.

This is kind of cool, actually; it gives me a couple of weeks of free
time with money to relax, and as tired as I still am from the road trip,
I think I might go back to Arizona again. I might even tell some other
people that I'm there this time. I have to be back in time to move into
my new apartment though. Since I don't work at Trolltech, I also don't
get to live in the Trolltech-sponsored housing; I'm crashing at my
friend Cliff's place currently, and I don't move into my own place until
next week.

At least I can't complain that my life is boring.
