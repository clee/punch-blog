I have Final Fantasy III(US, VI in Japan) on the way. Super Metroid has
already arrived, and I am Super Nintendo-less.

I wonder if this is what it feels like to die of thirst in the ocean.

Should have brought the fucking SNES with me when I moved. I SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT IT. Failing that, how the \*fuck\* did I manage to not grab it
when I was back down there in May? HOW?

The mind boggles.
