title: hooray for migration!

So there's some pretty [heavy discussion][] on the kde-core-devel list
about migrating from CVS to Subversion for the entire KDE project.

All I can say is, the sooner, the better.

Of course, I'm very much of the mind that tla \> svn \> cvs, but as long
as we're moving up the stack, even if marginally, it's still progress.
Plus, svn has the feature that it is much more like tla than CVS is, and
the cvs2svn guys have already written an impressive script to convert
the ancient RCS files into changesets. And since both Subversion and
Arch are changeset-oriented... I'm very excited. In my mind at least, it
shouldn't be too insanely difficult to migrate from svn to tla in the
future...
