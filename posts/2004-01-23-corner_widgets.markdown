got an email from ceebx tonight - this guy rules. not only is Plastik
the single most visually attractive style I've used (well, aside from
the ones I've written, of course ;) but he sends me suggestions for
problems that he comes across.

now, the current suggestion he sent me doesn't seem to be working just
yet, but I'm sure I'll get it to. I hate QTabWidgets.
