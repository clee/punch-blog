So on Thursday, I get a phone call around five in the evening.

It's my mom. I flip a coin and decide "WTF, might as well answer it."

She says, "I'm at the airport. You should come pick me up." I respond
with, "Haha, mom. Very funny, but that'd be *my* line, remember?"

(Backstory: Around Christmas, I was on the phone with the family and I
tell my mom this plan that I've been cooking for a few weeks, which was
basically that I was going to neglect to inform anyone in advance of my
plans to come visit. Meaning that, once I did show up, I'd be totally
unexpected and unannounced. It's more fun that way. I explained that the
only notice that she'd have would be my phone call from the airport,
saying, "Hey, you should come pick me up or something.")

Apparently, my mom and I think more alike than even I want to admit. She
had already bought her ticket to come up here by the time that we had
this conversation around the holidays. She's here now, sitting on the
sofa near me, rocking out to Bon Jovi.

And there's food in the fridge again.

Damn, I love having my mommy around.
