Steph got me sick.

She had a runny nose and a little tiny wussy cough when she came up this
weekend but it hit me quite a bit harder last night. This morning
doesn't feel quite so bad - my throat is still a little sore, and my
sinuses are a little clogged up, but my nose is mostly not running now.
Which is definitely an improvement.

Even my tattoo can't make up for the inherent unsexiness of coughing my
brains out.

Still evaluating whether or not Cassie will be safe from infection if I
go to see her today. Should probably find a doctor... I have health
benefits for a reason, right?
