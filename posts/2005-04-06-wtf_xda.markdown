[@ajax] so working on DRI for i128, i turned off XAA  
[@ajax] in the spirit of experimentation, i ran xcompmgr -a  
[@ajax] it feels \_much\_ faster now  
[@ajax] like, firefox doesn't tear when scrolling  
[@ajax] it's kinda weird  
[@daniels] hmm  
[@daniels] maybe we should rename it to XDA :P  
[@ajax] totally unaccelerated, but just fast enough to feel useful  
[@ajax] the only unpleasant part is switching desktops
