it's been almost a week since my last blog! damn. I resolved to make
sure to update this more often. not even four weeks and I'm already
falling behind.

yesterday was fun. Caitie, Nuge, Brandi, Josh, and I all went to Red
Sea. Kevin was over there (surprise surprise!) and Cliff showed up
eventually, as did Steph, It was like a party or something, almost.
everybody's decided that they're going to throw me a huge going-away
party, although the little details (like "when" and "where") have yet to
be decided. sounds like good fun though.

Steph took advantage of Brandi being there, and apologized to her. Or so
she says. haven't heard Brandi's side of the story yet. still, it's nice
to hear that Steph's trying to be less caustic. she got me a gift
yesterday, too, completely unexpectedly. the Onion calendar. hooray! new
Onion every day for the rest of the year.

that's about all. the last week hasn't been that interesting. tonight
should be, though. Caitie and Nuge and I have finally agreed to do our
intervention with Jessica. no idea how that's going to go, but ... it
needs to be done. Jessica is a really great friend, and an amazing
woman, and she deserves far better than what she's currently getting.
anyway.
