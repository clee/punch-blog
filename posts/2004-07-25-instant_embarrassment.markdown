Daniel and I originally planned on staying in Canada until Tuesday or
so; instead, we left yesterday and got a head start. We made *excellent*
time on the trip home; it took just over five hours for us to make it
from Ottawa to Nashua, including two stops for gas.

OLS registration: \$250 CDN  
Hotel stay at Les Suites: \$215/night, CDN  
Pizza at 2AM: \$20 CDN  
Two tanks of gas: \$40 USD  
The look on Steph's face when we showed up three days early: Priceless

(Incidentally, that Mastercard marketing campaign was simply stunning.
Hooray for corporate marketing!)

Seriously, though; the look on Steph's face was just awesome. The
apartment is a total mess; she didn't do any laundry, and everything is
awesome. Her hair looks dead sexy though. (She dyed it red, apparently
just finishing the process before we got home.)

OLS rocked. Daniel and I both agreed that we definitely have to do it
again next year, only next time 1) We're taking our time getting up
there. Two or three days each way. There's too much fun stuff that we
missed out on this time. And 2) Steph has gotta go with us. Maybe we can
get her involved in some sort of documentation effort, or translation,
or something; it doesn't really matter. I'm sure we can get her involved
in the community somehow, and once she is she'll have a valid reason for
coming.

And one of the few things that sucked about OLS was not having Steph
around. I really wasn't expecting to miss her that much, but I did.

Now. Since we're back home, there's this rather large Netserver LXr Pro
which needs an operating system. I've got the idea into my head that I
want LDAP user accounts and Kerberos passwords in the apartment, so
we'll see. I need to get an OS booting on this thing first though, which
looks like it may actually be easier said than done...
