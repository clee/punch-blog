Published Asteroid on [looky][] today. Should be interesting to see what
kinds of responses I get to it. I'm sure that nobody will ilsten to my
"If you don't like it don't use it and don't bitch" disclaimer, but oh
well. Such is life.

In other news, I should be able to hack on my dotNET config page
Sometime Soon (TM) so hopefully I can finally get that uploaded into
CVS. I know I've promised it before, but honest - it's coming!

And other stuff is on the horizon. I love KDE development. Also, the
guys from Sun's Project Looking Glass team kick ass. (I met them at the
[xdevconf][] last week.)
