Heh. Just remembered this snippet of conversation between Steph and
myself:

**clee:** http://www.thinkgeek.com/oreilly/tshirts/5eb7/  
**clee:** For me  
**clee:** http://www.thinkgeek.com/oreilly/tshirts/6388/  
**clee:** For you  
**steph:** We should get those and wear them at the same time and then
go out!  
**clee:** :D  
**steph:** Geek Central  
**clee:** That would be awesome :)  
**clee:** And the best part, of course, would be us taking pictures, and
then posting them on our blogs :D

We will have those shirts. Oh yes.

I scare myself sometimes.
