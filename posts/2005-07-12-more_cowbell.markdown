I may be abusing my 'tech/KDE' category with this entry, but so be it.

A [new tagging application called 'cowbell'][] is out and it looks
pretty boring. Reading through it I was mostly uninterested until I hit
this part:

<p>
> It requires the Mono runtime, Gtk\#, and TagLib to install and run.

Holy crap! GTK/GNOME apps using evil KDE technology! THE SKIES THEY ARE
FALLING I TELL YOU.

Seriously though, good on them. [TagLib][] is good stuff, and I'm glad
to see that they're not reinventing the wheel. More projects need to use
it.
