I wrote a new style from scratch a long time ago called Asteroid. It was
done half as a gag, and half because I was bored. I also decided to
implement it from scratch (instead of following my usual method of
hacking on the dotNET code) so that I could provide a better platform
for others to build their styles on. (As an aside, I also took out all
of the Asteroid-specific code and put it into a Skeleton style, which is
BSD-licensed and available on my site).

However, being that I'm lazy and Asteroid got Good Enough TM for me to
use without being too annoyed with it, Asteroid was put on hold at
version 0.2. Until today, that is. I got an email from David Chester,
with the Munjoy Linux distribution, and he has implemented much more of
the widget style code, and submitted his changes back to me. (As an
aside, Munjoy looks quite nifty, and I'm going to have to try it out.
KDE + Debian = Righteous.)

So, yeah. I started something neat, and somebody else picked it up and
ran with it. Open Source code rocks.
