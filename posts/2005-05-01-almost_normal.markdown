title: almost normal

I'm feeling much healthier. Maybe the title is a bit of a misnomer,
since we all know that I'm not anywhere close to "normal," but my throat
seems to be almost completely healed and it no longer hurts to breathe,
eat, or swallow.

By some assorted cleverness, I have managed to secure an upgrade to an
Athlon 64 and a much nicer new case, for a net cost of about \$20 to me.
I'm excited.

I need to pick a project to get back into KDE hacking with.

Not much else is new. Found a really awesome pizza place a few weeks
ago, and have been eating there regularly. A \$10 pizza lasts me two or
three days, which is awesome. Saving money is good.
