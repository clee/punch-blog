Can't really think of anything funny or clever to say about this; I had
surgery for my hernia today, and it went well, I suppose. I survived,
and now I have a surprisingly large incision which has been covered in
superglue. It's going to form a bad-ass scar.

My surgeon prescribed vicodin and ibuprofen. I'm not entirely sure that
either of those is helping me at all.

I was told before I went under the knife that the vicodin they were
giving me was basically diazepam, which made me think of Metal Gear
Solid, and I was happy. Visions of long, drawn-out boss fights with
Sniper Wolf danced through my head. Unfortunately, it turns out that the
nurse lied to me, and vicodin is not in fact diazepam.

Incidentally, I had my prescriptions filled at Target, because of their
totally sweet ClearRx bottles. If you haven't heard of them, you should
[check out the story][] about why they're awesome.

Anyway. I'm alive, and that's something.
