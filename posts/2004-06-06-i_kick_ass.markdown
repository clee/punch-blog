Tonight is rocking hardcore.

I spent about twenty minutes autotooling the 'nv' driver from the old
monolithic X server tree, and convinced it to build under Daniel's
Xizzle/Xorg tree.

After a bit more hacking around with the build system (to get it to
properly generate the Makefiles in the nv dir, and to get the new NV
driver module loaded into the libdrivers.a), it actually worked!

It loads the driver, and it sets the proper resolution, and everything!

Now the only thing missing is composite support. Which is a little out
of my league, but I have faith that the guys at Sun working on it (yeah,
I'm looking at you, Stu and Deron) will pull it off.

Damn, this has been a good night.
