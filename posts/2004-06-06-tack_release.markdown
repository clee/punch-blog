title: tack release

With the advent of [planet KDE][], we need a decent blog posting utility
for KDE. This isn't it, but it might become that utility if enough
people send patches to me (or hey, you can always fork it!)

Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, I present to you:

[Tack 0.0][], the most minimalist and feature-starved blog posting
utility KDE has ever seen. It needs loving, lots of it, and as I'm going
to be on an airplane later on today I can't give it the loving it so
deserves.

So download it, marvel at its simplicity and lack of functionality, and
then hack on it and send me patches so that it stops sucking so much.

That is all.
