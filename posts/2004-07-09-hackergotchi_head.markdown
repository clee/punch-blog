title: hackergotchi head
published: true
---

So I've taken the time out of my day to gimp up a [picture][] of myself
to use as a hackergotchi head. It's not a particularly great pic, but I
figured it had the most potential for hackergotchi status.

I like the way it turned out. Any other guys here on Planet KDE, if you
take the time out to do this, [send me the PNG file][] and I'll upload
it and get it set for you so that you too can have a floating
disembodied head.

If you do decide to gimp yourself up then please note that the image
should be about 64 pixels wide to fit properly. Anything from 60 to 80
pixels tall will work for the height, but let's try not to make the
images \_too\_ large.

(And yes, I'll host the images here so that your web server won't melt.)
