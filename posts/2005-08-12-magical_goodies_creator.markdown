Adam: I have a [tax-free holiday][] every day of the week; it's called
"Living in New Hampshire."

(There's no sales tax in this state, for the readers out there who are
confused.)

Work on the tdfx EXA support is still ongoing; I have the framebuffer
addresses properly set up now, but my blit and solid fill routines are
completely hosed. At least I have an idea of how things are \*supposed\*
to work now.
