title: new design!

Still kicking the tires, and it's taken me a few hours of fiddling,
but I've configured [punch][] to spit out HTML for my blog. (Not
sure if punch will be sticking around; I mostly wanted to see if I
*could* get it to work, but [magneto][] or [pelican][] may end up
being a better fit.)

The design is also shiny and new. I stole some ideas from
[John August][]'s site, and I built this layout on top of
[Skeleton][]â€”I've gotten tired of seeing bootstrap everywhere,
so I figured I'd try something new. The layout is fully responsive
now; it should scale properly to phones, tablets, and even giant 30"
displays, all without sacrificing readability.

Fonts for this design are [Orbitron][] for the headers and
[NoticiaText][] for the body text.
