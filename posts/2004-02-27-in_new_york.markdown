I'm finally in New York, and I've actually been here for a couple of
weeks now. been a while since I updated the blog so I figured "what the
hell" and decided to go ahead and post a bit of info.

the job search hasn't been too promising so far, but Syracuse is
gorgeous. I really love the area, and the fact that snow is all over the
place probably has something to do with it. everyone here thinks I'm
insane because I love the cold; maybe I am actually crazy, but I still
get a kick out of it.

haven't had much time to hack on KDE lately, what with trying to find
viable employment. my aunt has this great idea that I should be the
Easter Bunny or one of his assistants; I'm really not too into the idea
personally, but I do have to admit that it'd probably be pretty funny if
I had to resort to that. I mean, it'd suck terribly for me of course.
but it'd still be hilarious, and maybe in a few years I'd be able to
laugh about it. maybe.
