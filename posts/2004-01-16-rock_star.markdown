I got an email from a Linux distributor today asking me if I would mind
going into some detail on my widget style experience. Hopefully my reply
will make a good impression, since I've done a pretty decent amount of
work in this field; I think it'd rock if I were hired as a consultant or
contracted out to for development work.

Life can be funny. I never expected that my after-school hobby might
eventually open up so many doors for me. It's not quite the same as
being a rock star, but life could definitely be much worse.
