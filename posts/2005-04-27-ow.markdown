strep throat sucks. I've had this soreness in my throat since Friday
last week, and it kept getting worse. Finally, on Sunday, I went to the
doctor and found out "Hey, you've got strep!"

Now I've got penicillin and cough drops. Throat still hurts. Wish my
white blood cells weren't such little bitches. They're supposed to
\*handle\* this stuff for me, dammit.
