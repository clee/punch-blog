I love MacOS X. I don't mince words about it; the UI is gorgeous,
simple, to-the-point, and I love it. I love Linux as well, but mainly
because it's usually a challenge to get working right. After getting
particularly bored the other day, and I thought to myself "You know,
self, this iMac works entirely too well." Seven hours later, Gentoo is
up and (mostly) running.

Major props out to the guys who wrote parted, the guy who wrote the
patches to parted to let it resize HFS+ filesystems without destroying
data (if I ever meet you, I owe you a beer), and whoever wrote the
driver for reading HFS+ volumes under Linux. All of this stuff makes
using Linux on a Mac a much more pleasant experience.

Back in OS X land, though, the guys who I'm the most impressed with are
the team behind [Colloquy][] which is hands-down, the single coolest
Open Source application I've seen on OS X yet. I've seen a few other
apps that I consider to have great user interfaces, but Colloquy is the
only Open Source one. These guys are seriously awesome.
