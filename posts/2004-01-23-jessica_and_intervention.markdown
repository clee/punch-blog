the intervention didn't happen. Caitie got cold feet, chickened out, and
didn't even show up until twenty minutes before Jessica left. I feel
like shit.

Jessica really is too good for her boyfriend. that's really all there is
too it. I wish I could have convinced Caitie to go through with it, but
my persuasive skills aren't what they used to be, I guess. oh well... I
tried, and I failed. it really does make me sad though.
