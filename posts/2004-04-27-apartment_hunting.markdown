Have to go apartment hunting today. (I'm in Boston for the week, looking
at the area and seeing what's around here.) Basically, it looks like I'm
going to get face-raped by someone with a running start. A grand a month
for a one-bedroom... it makes me want to cry.

Oh well. This is a good problem to have. Much better than the "homeless,
jobless, and starving" problem I was facing a few months ago. Although
if I can't find a place for a low-enough price, I may be facing that
problem again.

On the bright side of things, the X Developers Conference starts
tomorrow and that should be a blast.
