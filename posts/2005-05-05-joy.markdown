My new toys arrived today.

That's one [Lian-Li PC-60][], one Chaintech VNF4/Ultra motherboard, and
one Athlon64 3000+ CPU.

This machine is officially fast enough to scare me. I can play Doom3 at
my monitor's native resolution (1680x1050) and the frame rate doesn't
drop below 60fps even with baddies on the screen.

The only other goodies I need to complete this box are a couple of 400G
SATA drives. The Hitachi model is only \$275 on NewEgg, which means that
it's now possible to put over 1TB of storage into a box for under
\$1000.

Holy shit life is good.
