HDTV service was installed and turned on yesterday. Still feeling a
little sick and not so hot, but I'm going in to work today.

The new Smallville season looks **good** so far. I love that show. I
have to admit, I didn't really like Lois at first but her personality
has already started growing on me. I just wish that Comcast offered the
WB in HD up here.
