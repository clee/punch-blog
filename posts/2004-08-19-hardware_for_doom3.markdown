title: hardware for doom3
published: true

new CPU and 1.5GB of RAM arrived yesterday to bolster my hardware so
that I can actually play Doom 3.

That game is the first game since Silent Hill to make me actually afraid
to go around the next corner.

It's awesome.

Playing it in the dark, on my TV, with the sound turned waaaay up, is
absolutely terrifying, and by far one of the best gaming experiences
I've ever had.

If only they'd release Linux binaries. Carmack, are you listening? I
hate Windows and I'm sick of putting up with weird random shit just so I
can play your masterpiece of a game.

::sigh::
