There is a lot of really useless code sitting in Xorg today.

I was playing with a CVS checkout and noticed a large chunk of one of
the source files was commented out with \#if 0; so, this piqued my
curiosity and I decided to figure out how many blocks of code are
commented out with \#if 0 in the server, driver, and lib trees.

The current count, in CVS HEAD, as of about five minutes ago:

  module    blocks of \#if 0 code
  --------- -----------------------
  libs      56
  server    408
  drivers   648

</p>
All combined, that's 1112 blocks of code completely disabled at compile
time just sitting there in the tree.

Haven't bothered checking any of the other modules; I'm sure there's
more in apps but I don't really think it matters for docs or fonts.
Still. That's a lot of useless crap.
