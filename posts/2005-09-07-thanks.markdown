Everybody else has been saying this on mailing-lists and whatnot, but I
figured that it deserved saying on the Planet, too.

Antonio, aKademy 2005 rocked hardcore thanks to you and the LiMa guys.
You guys kick ass. I didn't think it'd be possible to top Kastle, but
you guys did it.

To next year! Helio, you ready for aKademy in Brazil? ;)
