Got another new keyboard. The Logitech one that I was happy with before
ended up not being nearly as rockalicious as I had initially thought.
Programmable keys, yada yada, USB blah blah, shitty. No, [caillon][] was
cool enough to buy me a [Model M keyboard][]. CLICKETY FOR LIFE!

And since I have had this one in my hands, I have realized just how much
faster and more accurately I type on these keyboards. I missed that
feeling. If only someone would make a USB-native Model M... (Oh, and I
ordered another one from eBay which was apparently delivered to my
apartment's office building this morning but I wasn't here.)

Seriously. These keyboards totally rule.

Incidentally, the one that caillon purchased was in fact not an original
Model M but remade by the Keepers of the One True Keyboard, those saints
at [PC Keyboard][]. These guys rule. I have no relation to them save
that of the delighted recipient of one of their fine products.
