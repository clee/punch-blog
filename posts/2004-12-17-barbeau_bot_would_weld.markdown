I got glasses yesterday.

It's the first time I've had glasses since the eighth grade. Definitely
taking a bit of getting used to. Not having peripheral vision is a very
strange thing to get re-accustomed to. Also, the fact that things blur
slightly around the edges of the lenses is a little weird. Seeing
reflections of people and things in the lenses is also strange (yay for
my rearview vision!)

Reaction to the glasses has been pretty positive, overall. Lots of
people had no idea that my vision is this bad. I may in fact have the
worst vision in the entire Westford office.

Good times.
