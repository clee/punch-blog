title: almost wrecked my car tonight
published: true

I dropped tberman off at the Westford Regency Inn and on the way home, I
took exit \#35B from the 495. That particular exit is a little bit
sharp. I was going about thirty and I probably should have been going
about twenty, and my car started to slide as it hydroplaned. Amazingly
enough, I managed to control the slide and even though I did pull a
\*sweet\* 180, I didn't even scratch the car. Nor did I get hurt.

So for all you folks out there rooting for my death, I have cheated you
once again. Bitches.
