It's been a while since I last blogged; I know, I suck. Deal with it.

I was supposed to be in Norway as of two months ago, but as it turns
out, the Norwegian government apparently hates me. My work visa has yet
to be approved, so I'm currently in California working at Trolltech's
office in Palo Alto on a short-term contract.

"But, Chris - how did you end up in California? I thought you were in
Boston!"

Yes, yes, I was. I was in Boston until I ran out of sofas to crash on.
Then I took my car and talked a crazy friend of mine (the [author of
naim][] to be precise) into doing a cross-country road trip with me. We
made the trip from Boston to Phoenix in about forty-two hours, give or
take.

I spent a few weeks in Chandler, leeching off of my parents, and
generally trying to figure out my next move. I had a lot of fun while I
was there - my friend Josh left for the Navy right before I left to come
out here to CA, so I was there for his sendoff party, and that was
pretty great.

Oh, and I have a girlfriend now - scarily enough, she's not completely
insane or otherwise mentally handicapped, yet she still likes me. So, to
all my secret admirers out there: You should've moved faster! Now I'm
taken, and it's too late.

Saturday can't get here fast enough.
