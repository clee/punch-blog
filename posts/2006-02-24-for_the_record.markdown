[![user info][]airlied][]: I'd be a lot less annoyed with companies like
ATI if they shipped drivers (even proprietary ones!) that actually
supported their latest cards.

The R5xx-series cards have been out for *MONTHS* now and there's still
no acceleration, 2D **or** 3D, Open Source **or** proprietary. Good job,
ATI!

Anyway. I'm excited about the way that things are headed, and I'm really
glad that other people are getting excited, too.

To the people who were wondering - the "AI" in "AIGLX" stands for
Accelerated Indirect - it's basically required to do a lot of neat
things like using the local card to render OpenGL from a remote
application. It also enables all sorts of kick-ass effects like the new
bling in metacity and compiz (which doesn't work yet, but it's only a
matter of time).
