I hate caffeine deprivation headaches.

(For those of you following from home, yes, I had successfully kicked my
caffine habit but then I realized that not drinking it sucked. So I
started drinking it again. And just now, I went a couple of days without
- again - and all of a sudden I've got the headaches. Fuck.)

Also, Smallville is still one of my favorite TV shows. I honestly can't
decide if I like it more than Battlestar Galactica or not.
