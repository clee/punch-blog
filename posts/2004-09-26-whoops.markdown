Ran out of disk space on tycho for a minute there.

For those of you who don't know, tycho is the machine which hosts not
only c133.org (and this my web site and email) but also planetKDE.org
and Daniel Stone's fooishbar.org.

So when it runs out of disk space, planet KDE goes down and my email
stops arriving which makes me sad.

It was getting to be about time to archive the email off again anyway.
I'm up to 100M again in my Maildirs. Ugh.
