I've been playing with ATA over Ethernet on my home network and I have
to say, it is pretty damn sweet.

In fact, it would be absolutely perfect if I could use AOE to share
drives to my media center, and then use ZFS on that machine.
Unfortunately, Linux doesn't have ZFS, and OpenSolaris doesn't seem to
have AOE yet. (The Coraid site has a Solaris driver, and they claim it
works on Solaris 7+, but there is no source and I don't happen to have
an OpenSolaris machine to test it on at the moment.)

But - the ability to pool together all of my disparate disks into one
gigantic volume is awesome. It's like Voltron, but with hard drives
instead of robots.
