{lady friend}: no you're my examplar of what the guys i date have to
live up to :-p

Wow.

I'm humbled. I had no idea that I was anywhere near that cool.

Of course, this means I'm just going to be that much **more**
insufferable in the Real World, because I rock so much. But yeah, I was
really surprised that someone out there thinks that of me.
